[when]
when will a person survive 
when does a person survive
when is a person died  
what features do i need for died


[why]
why do you predict the instance as died?
why do you predict died?
why do you predict the instance as died
why did you predict the outcome
why do you predict died
why did you predict this outcome
why did this person died

[why-not]
why is n't the predicted outcome died
why is n't the instance 's predicted value survived
why didn't x die
why did n't this person die
why did n't x die
why isn't the predicted outcome died
why did n't the person survive

[targetvalues]
what are possible predictions
what will the outcomes be
what can be the outcomes
what are the possible predictions
which can be the outcomes
which are the outcomes
which can be the outcome
what can the outcomes be

[how-to]
what has to be changed to get a died survived person
what has to be changed to get a died person
what do i have to change to get a died person
what has to be changed to get a died result
what has to be changed to get a died outcome
what has to be adjusted to get a died person
what has to be different to get a died person
what has to be modified to get a died person
